				Story

					As an agent, I want to be able to differentiate between missed and abandoned calls so that I can take an action according to each.

					🧾 Description

					GIVEN I’m an agent using Aircall app

					WHEN I’m treating the calls in my To do

					THEN I need to be able to differentiate between missed and abandoned calls

					📝 Acceptance criteria:

					Included in the smart checklist 

					If there are abandoned calls they should be under an “Abandoned calls” group in the To do page.

					If there are abandoned calls the “Abandoned calls” group should be just after the “Missed calls”.

					If there aren’t any abandoned calls the “Abandoned calls” group is not visible in the To do page.

					If there are abandoned calls under the “Abandoned calls” group in the To do we should display the number of abandoned calls in the title

					If the user clicks on an abandoned call card we should open the ‘Call details’ page

					When opening an “Abandoned call” call details the user should see the “Incoming call abandoned” category with its respective icon and missed reason.

					When opening an “Abandoned call” call details the user should be able to add notes, tags, assign, archive or call back.

					If the user hovers an abandoned call card then the selection and call possibilities appear.

					If the user clicks on the three dots menu on the right of the card then he should be able to assign it to himself, assign it to someone else, archive it or copy the number.

					If the user selects and abandoned call then the user should be able to archive it or assign it.

					The card displayed for an Abandoned call has a different icon and colour as other cards in the To do

					If the user clicks on the phone icon and the call is answered or goes to voicemail, then the abandoned call should not appear under Abandoned calls” group anymore.

					If the user clicks on the phone icon and the call is not answered, then the abandoned call should should stay under Abandoned calls” group.
